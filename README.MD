**COZY CORNER!**

__### The _new_ old internet ###__

_welcome to __Cozy Corner__, a digital haven crafted to capture the charm & creative spirit of 90's web design. taking inspiration from platforms like geocities, and the vast collection of unique & expressive user-created webpages that followed._

todays social media lacks a lot of the fun & quirkiness that early digital social-networking platforms had. they are mostly motivated by ad revenue, clicks, and milking $ from their users. social media no longer feels 'fun'.  
  
Cozy Corner is a place where internet users can connect. no friends list. no likes. no profile pictures. no ads. just sum internet friends havin' fun together, looking to connect & discuss the world wide web.  
  
come reminisce about the beauty of early web-design in the chatroom or engage in conversation about anything u want in the forum. we have even enhanced the user-experience, so hopefully you can experience that sweet, sweet nostalgia without anything breaking. :)
